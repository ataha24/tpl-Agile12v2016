# tpl-Agile12v2016
The Agile12v2016 is an ultra-high field template created locally at our institution (Center for Functional and Metabolic Mapping at Western University)


It consists of 12 healthy control subjects (6 female; age: 27.6 ± 4.4 years). Scans were on a 7-T scanner (Agilent, Santa Clara, California, USA/Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) via a 24-channel transmit-receive head coil array.
